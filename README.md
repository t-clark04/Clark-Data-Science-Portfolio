# Data Science Portfolio - Tommy Clark

This repository contains all of my data science-related projects completed over the course of the semester in MDSC 20009: Introduction to Data Science.📊 Projects are grouped either by their implemented techniques (i.e. machine learning, LLMs, etc.) or according to their corresponding step in the data science workflow (i.e. EDA, data cleaning, visualization, etc.). 📈 Links to project repositories will be provided to make it easier to locate code of interest. 🔗 Once enough projects have been completed, a table of contents will be added. The portfolio as a whole will be updated on a regular basis.

## Basic EDA

Basic streamlit app allowing users to filter and explore the Palmer's Penguins dataset. Showcases my proficiency with the streamlit library, as well as my skills in working with pandas DataFrames. Dataset contains measurements on three different species of penguins living on the Palmer Archipelago in Antarctica. Navigate to the [basic-streamlit-app](https://github.com/t-clark04/Clark-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/basic-streamlit-app) folder for more information and  instructions on how to run the app yourself!

## Data Cleaning and Visualization
<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="Images/Olympics.webp"> **[Tidy Data Project 🧹 ✨](https://github.com/t-clark04/Clark-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project)**

Project demonstrating my expertise in data cleaning and visualization in Python using libraries like ``pandas``, ``seaborn``, and ``matplotlib``. Starting with a messy dataset on the medalists at the 2008 Summer Olympics, I re-format the data into a "tidy" data frame and explore relationships in variables (like `Gender` and `Sport`) through pivot tables and visualizations.
