# Data Science Portfolio - Tommy Clark

This repository contains all of my data science-related projects completed over the course of the semester in MDSC 20009: Introduction to Data Science.📊 Projects are grouped either by their implemented techniques (i.e. machine learning, LLMs, etc.) or according to their corresponding step in the data science workflow (i.e. EDA, data cleaning, visualization, etc.). 📈 Links to project repositories will be provided to make it easier to locate code of interest. 🔗 The portfolio will be updated on a regular basis.

## Basic EDA

  - Showcases my proficiency with the ``streamlit`` library, as well as my skills in wrangling and filtering ``pandas`` DataFrames in Python.
  - Allows users to filter and explore the Palmer's Penguins dataset, which contains measurements on penguins living on the Palmer Archipelago.
  - Click [here](https://clark-penguins.streamlit.app), or navigate over to the [basic-streamlit-app](https://github.com/t-clark04/Clark-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/basic-streamlit-app) folder for more info!

## Data Cleaning and Visualization
<img align="left" width="275" height="200" src="Images/Olympics.webp"> **[Tidy Data Project 🧹 ✨](https://github.com/t-clark04/Clark-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project)**  

- Demonstrates my expertise in data cleaning and visualization using Python libraries like ``pandas``, ``seaborn``, and ``matplotlib``.
- Starting with a "messy" Olympic dataset, I first re-format the data into a ["tidy"](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10) data frame and then explore relationships in variables (like Gender and Sport) through pivot tables and visualizations.

## Machine Learning
<img align="left" width="275" height="200" src="Images/NBA.jpg"> **[Supervised Machine Learning App 🤖🏀](https://github.com/t-clark04/Clark-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/MLStreamlitApp)**

- Displays my ability to develop and deploy interactive web applications with ``streamlit`` and build classification models with ``scikit-learn``.
- Allows the user to explore machine learning models, tune hyperparameters, and make predictions on user-uploaded data or a provided NBA dataset.
- Click [here](https://clark-machine-learning.streamlit.app/) to check it out, or see [MLSStreamlitApp](https://github.com/t-clark04/Clark-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/MLStreamlitApp) for the full description.
- **ML Models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors**

<br clear="all">

<img align="left" width="275" height="200" src="Images/MLB.jpg"> **[Unsupervised Machine Learning App ⚾📈](https://github.com/t-clark04/Clark-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/MLUnsupervisedApp)**

- Showcases my mastery of ``streamlit`` web applications and understanding of both clustering and dimensionality reduction models in ``scikit-learn``.
- Prompts users to select clustering variables, choose their desired models, tune hyperparameters, and explore a customized ``plotly`` scatterplot.
- Check out the app [here](https://clark-unsupervised.streamlit.app/), or navigate to [MLUnsupervisedApp](https://github.com/t-clark04/Clark-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/MLUnsupervisedApp) for more info!  
- **ML Models: K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, PCA, t-SNE**
