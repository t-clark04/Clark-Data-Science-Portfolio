# Data Science Portfolio - Tommy Clark

This repository contains all of my data science-related projects completed over the course of the semester in MDSC 20009: Introduction to Data Science.📊 Projects are grouped either by their implemented techniques (i.e. machine learning, LLMs, etc.) or according to their corresponding step in the data science workflow (i.e. EDA, data cleaning, visualization, etc.). 📈 Links to project repositories will be provided to make it easier to locate code of interest. 🔗 Once enough projects have been completed, a table of contents will be added. The portfolio as a whole will be updated on a regular basis.

## Basic EDA

Basic app showcasing my proficiency with the streamlit library, as well as my skills in working with pandas DataFrames. Allows users to filter and explore the Palmer's Penguins dataset, which contains measurements on three different species of penguins living on the Palmer Archipelago in Antarctica. Navigate to the [basic-streamlit-app](https://github.com/t-clark04/Clark-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/basic-streamlit-app) folder for more information and for instructions on how to run the app yourself!

## Data Cleaning and Visualization

Project demonstrating my expertise in data cleaning and visualization using Python libraries like ``pandas``, ``seaborn``, and ``matplotlib``. Starting with a "messy" dataset on the 2008 Olympic medalists, I first re-format the data into a ["tidy"](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10) data frame and then explore relationships in variables (like `Gender` and `Sport`) through pivot tables and visualizations to generate insights.
